**Employee Table**
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| salary      | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table contains information about the salary of an employee.
```
 
Write an SQL query to report the second highest salary from the `Employee` table. If there is no second highest salary, the query should report `null`.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
| 2  | 200    |
| 3  | 300    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| 200                 |
+---------------------+
```

__Example 2:__
```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+--------+
| id | salary |
+----+--------+
| 1  | 100    |
+----+--------+
Output:
+---------------------+
| SecondHighestSalary |
+---------------------+
| null                |
+---------------------+
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    MAX(salary) AS "SecondHighestSalary"
FROM
    Employee
WHERE
    salary NOT IN (
        SELECT
            MAX(salary)
        FROM
            Employee
    );
```
