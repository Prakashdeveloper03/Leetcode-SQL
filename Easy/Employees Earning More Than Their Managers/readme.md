**Employee Table**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
| managerId   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an employee, their name, salary, and the ID of their manager.
```
 
Write an SQL query to find the employees who earn more than their managers.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Employee table:
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| id | name  | salary | managerId |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
| 1  | Joe   | 70000  | 3         |
| 2  | Henry | 80000  | 4         |
| 3  | Sam   | 60000  | Null      |
| 4  | Max   | 90000  | Null      |
+----+-------+--------+-----------+
Output:
+----------+
| Employee |
+----------+
| Joe      |
+----------+
Explanation: Joe is the only employee who earns more than his manager.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    emp.name AS Employee
FROM
    Employee AS emp
    INNER JOIN Employee AS manager ON emp.managerId = manager.id
WHERE
    emp.salary > manager.salary;
```
