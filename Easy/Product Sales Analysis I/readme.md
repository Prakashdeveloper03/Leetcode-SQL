**Sales Table**
```
+-------------+-------+
| Column Name | Type  |
+-------------+-------+
| sale_id     | int   |
| product_id  | int   |
| year        | int   |
| quantity    | int   |
| price       | int   |
+-------------+-------+
(sale_id, year) is the primary key of this table.
product_id is a foreign key to Product table.
Each row of this table shows a sale on the product product_id in a certain year.
Note that the price is per unit.
```

**Product Table**
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the product name of each product.
```
 
Write an SQL query that reports the `product_name`, `year`, and `price` for each sale_id in the `Sales` table.

Return the resulting table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Sales table:
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| sale_id | product_id | year | quantity | price |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+
| 1       | 100        | 2008 | 10       | 5000  |
| 2       | 100        | 2009 | 12       | 5000  |
| 7       | 200        | 2011 | 15       | 9000  |
+---------+------------+------+----------+-------+

Product table:
+------------+--------------+
| product_id | product_name |
+------------+--------------+
| 100        | Nokia        |
| 200        | Apple        |
| 300        | Samsung      |
+------------+--------------+

Output:
+--------------+-------+-------+
| product_name | year  | price |
+--------------+-------+-------+
| Nokia        | 2008  | 5000  |
| Nokia        | 2009  | 5000  |
| Apple        | 2011  | 9000  |
+--------------+-------+-------+

Explanation:
From sale_id = 1, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2008.
From sale_id = 2, we can conclude that Nokia was sold for 5000 in the year 2009.
From sale_id = 7, we can conclude that Apple was sold for 9000 in the year 2011.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_name,
    s.year,
    s.price
FROM
    Sales AS s
    LEFT JOIN Product AS p ON p.product_id = s.product_id;
```
