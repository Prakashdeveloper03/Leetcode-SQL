**Product Table**
```
+--------------+---------+
| Column Name  | Type    |
+--------------+---------+
| product_id   | int     |
| product_name | varchar |
| unit_price   | int     |
+--------------+---------+
product_id is the primary key of this table.
Each row of this table indicates the name and the price of each product.
```

**Sales Table**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| seller_id   | int     |
| product_id  | int     |
| buyer_id    | int     |
| sale_date   | date    |
| quantity    | int     |
| price       | int     |
+-------------+---------+
This table has no primary key, it can have repeated rows.
product_id is a foreign key to the Product table.
Each row of this table contains some information about one sale.
```
 
Write an SQL query that reports the **products** that were **only** sold in the first quarter of 2019. That is, between `2019-01-01` and `2019-03-31` inclusive.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Product table:
+------------+--------------+------------+
| product_id | product_name | unit_price |
+------------+--------------+------------+
| 1          | S8           | 1000       |
| 2          | G4           | 800        |
| 3          | iPhone       | 1400       |
+------------+--------------+------------+
Sales table:
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| seller_id | product_id | buyer_id | sale_date  | quantity | price |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
| 1         | 1          | 1        | 2019-01-21 | 2        | 2000  |
| 1         | 2          | 2        | 2019-02-17 | 1        | 800   |
| 2         | 2          | 3        | 2019-06-02 | 1        | 800   |
| 3         | 3          | 4        | 2019-05-13 | 2        | 2800  |
+-----------+------------+----------+------------+----------+-------+
Output:
+-------------+--------------+
| product_id  | product_name |
+-------------+--------------+
| 1           | S8           |
+-------------+--------------+
Explanation:
The product with id 1 was only sold in the spring of 2019.
The product with id 2 was sold in the spring of 2019 but was also sold after the spring of 2019.
The product with id 3 was sold after spring 2019.
We return only product 1 as it is the product that was only sold in the spring of 2019.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    product_id,
    product_name
FROM
    Product
WHERE
    product_id IN (
        SELECT
            product_id
        FROM
            Sales
        GROUP BY
            product_id
        HAVING
            MIN(sale_date) >= '2019-01-01'
            AND MAX(sale_date) <= '2019-03-31'
    )
```
