**Employees Table**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| employee_id | int     |
| name        | varchar |
| salary      | int     |
+-------------+---------+
employee_id is the primary key for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the employee ID, employee name, and salary.
```
Write an SQL query to calculate the bonus of each employee. The bonus of an employee is 100% of their salary if the ID of the employee is **an odd number** and **the employee name does not start with the character 'M'**. The bonus of an employee is 0 otherwise.

Return the result table ordered by `employee_id`.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Employees table:
+-------------+---------+--------+
| employee_id | name    | salary |
+-------------+---------+--------+
| 2           | Meir    | 3000   |
| 3           | Michael | 3800   |
| 7           | Addilyn | 7400   |
| 8           | Juan    | 6100   |
| 9           | Kannon  | 7700   |
+-------------+---------+--------+
Output:
+-------------+-------+
| employee_id | bonus |
+-------------+-------+
| 2           | 0     |
| 3           | 0     |
| 7           | 7400  |
| 8           | 0     |
| 9           | 7700  |
+-------------+-------+
Explanation:
The employees with IDs 2 and 8 get 0 bonus because they have an even employee_id.
The employee with ID 3 gets 0 bonus because their name starts with 'M'.
The rest of the employees get a 100% bonus.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    employee_id,
    CASE
        WHEN employee_id % 2 != 0
        AND name NOT LIKE 'M%' THEN salary
        ELSE 0
    END AS bonus
FROM
    Employees
ORDER BY
    employee_id
```
