**Logins Table**
```
+----------------+----------+
| Column Name    | Type     |
+----------------+----------+
| user_id        | int      |
| time_stamp     | datetime |
+----------------+----------+
(user_id, time_stamp) is the primary key for this table.
Each row contains information about the login time for the user with ID user_id.
```
 
Write an SQL query to report the latest login for all users in the year `2020`. Do not include the users who did not login in `2020`.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Logins table:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | time_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 6       | 2020-06-30 15:06:07 |
| 6       | 2021-04-21 14:06:06 |
| 6       | 2019-03-07 00:18:15 |
| 8       | 2020-02-01 05:10:53 |
| 8       | 2020-12-30 00:46:50 |
| 2       | 2020-01-16 02:49:50 |
| 2       | 2019-08-25 07:59:08 |
| 14      | 2019-07-14 09:00:00 |
| 14      | 2021-01-06 11:59:59 |
+---------+---------------------+
Output:
+---------+---------------------+
| user_id | last_stamp          |
+---------+---------------------+
| 6       | 2020-06-30 15:06:07 |
| 8       | 2020-12-30 00:46:50 |
| 2       | 2020-01-16 02:49:50 |
+---------+---------------------+
Explanation:
User 6 logged into their account 3 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 8 logged into their account 2 times in 2020, once in February and once in December. We include only the latest one (December) in the result table.
User 2 logged into their account 2 times but only once in 2020, so we include this login in the result table.
User 14 did not login in 2020, so we do not include them in the result table.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    user_id,
    MAX(time_stamp) AS last_stamp
FROM
    Logins
WHERE
    SUBSTRING(time_stamp, 1, 4) = "2020"
GROUP BY
    user_id;
```
