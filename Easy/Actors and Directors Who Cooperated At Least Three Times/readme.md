**ActorDirector Table**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| actor_id    | int     |
| director_id | int     |
| timestamp   | int     |
+-------------+---------+
timestamp is the primary key column for this table.
```
 
Write a SQL query for a report that provides the pairs (actor_id, director_id) where the actor has cooperated with the director at least three times.

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
ActorDirector table:
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id | timestamp   |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           | 0           |
| 1           | 1           | 1           |
| 1           | 1           | 2           |
| 1           | 2           | 3           |
| 1           | 2           | 4           |
| 2           | 1           | 5           |
| 2           | 1           | 6           |
+-------------+-------------+-------------+
Output:
+-------------+-------------+
| actor_id    | director_id |
+-------------+-------------+
| 1           | 1           |
+-------------+-------------+
Explanation: The only pair is (1, 1) where they cooperated exactly 3 times.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    actor_id,
    director_id
FROM
    ActorDirector
GROUP BY
    actor_id,
    director_id
HAVING
    COUNT(timestamp) >= 3
```
