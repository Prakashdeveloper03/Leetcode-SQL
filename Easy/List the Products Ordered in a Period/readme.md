There is no primary key for this table. It may have duplicate rows.
product_id is a foreign key to the Products table.
unit is the number of products ordered in order_date.
```
 
Write an SQL query to get the names of products that have at least `100` units ordered in February **2020** and their amount.

Return result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

| Leetcode Solutions | 130     |
| Leetcode Kit       | 100     |
+--------------------+---------+
Explanation:
Products with product_id = 1 is ordered in February a total of (60 + 70) = 130.
Products with product_id = 2 is ordered in February a total of 80.
Products with product_id = 3 is ordered in February a total of (2 + 3) = 5.
Products with product_id = 4 was not ordered in February 2020.
Products with product_id = 5 is ordered in February a total of (50 + 50) = 100.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    p.product_name AS product_name,
    sum(o.unit) AS unit
FROM
    Products p
    JOIN Orders o USING (product_id)
WHERE
    YEAR(o.order_date) = '2020'
    AND MONTH(o.order_date) = '02'
GROUP BY
    p.product_id
HAVING
    SUM(o.unit) >= 100;
```
