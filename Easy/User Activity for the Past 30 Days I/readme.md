**Activity Table**
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| user_id       | int     |
| session_id    | int     |
| activity_date | date    |
| activity_type | enum    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
The activity_type column is an ENUM of type ('open_session', 'end_session', 'scroll_down', 'send_message').
The table shows the user activities for a social media website.
Note that each session belongs to exactly one user.
```
 
Write an SQL query to find the daily active user count for a period of 30 days ending `2019-07-27` inclusively. A user was active on someday if they made at least one activity on that day.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Activity table:
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| user_id | session_id | activity_date | activity_type |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | scroll_down   |
| 1       | 1          | 2019-07-20    | end_session   |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-20    | open_session  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 2       | 4          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | open_session  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | send_message  |
| 3       | 2          | 2019-07-21    | end_session   |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | open_session  |
| 4       | 3          | 2019-06-25    | end_session   |
+---------+------------+---------------+---------------+

Output:
+------------+--------------+
| day        | active_users |
+------------+--------------+
| 2019-07-20 | 2            |
| 2019-07-21 | 2            |
+------------+--------------+
Explanation: Note that we do not care about days with zero active users.
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT activity_date AS "day",
    COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS "active_users"
FROM
    Activity
WHERE
    activity_date BETWEEN '2019-06-28'
    AND '2019-07-27'
GROUP BY
    activity_date
```
