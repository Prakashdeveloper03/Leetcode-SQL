**Weather Table**
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| id            | int     |
| recordDate    | date    |
| temperature   | int     |
+---------------+---------+
id is the primary key for this table.
This table contains information about the temperature on a certain day.
```
 
Write an SQL query to find all dates `Id` with higher temperatures compared to its previous dates (yesterday).

Return the result table in any order.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Weather table:
+----+------------+-------------+
| id | recordDate | temperature |
+----+------------+-------------+
| 1  | 2015-01-01 | 10          |
| 2  | 2015-01-02 | 25          |
| 3  | 2015-01-03 | 20          |
| 4  | 2015-01-04 | 30          |
+----+------------+-------------+
Output:
+----+
| id |
+----+
| 2  |
| 4  |
+----+
Explanation:
In 2015-01-02, the temperature was higher than the previous day (10 -> 25).
In 2015-01-04, the temperature was higher than the previous day (20 -> 30).
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    w1.id
FROM
    Weather AS w1,
    Weather AS w2
WHERE
    w1.temperature > w2.temperature
    AND w2.recordDate = DATE_SUB(w1.recordDate, INTERVAL 1 DAY);
```
