**Customer Table**
```
+-------------+---------+
| Column Name | Type    |
+-------------+---------+
| id          | int     |
| name        | varchar |
+-------------+---------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID and name of a customer.
```

**Orders Table**
```
+-------------+------+
| Column Name | Type |
+-------------+------+
| id          | int  |
| customerId  | int  |
+-------------+------+
id is the primary key column for this table.
customerId is a foreign key of the ID from the Customers table.
Each row of this table indicates the ID of an order and the ID of the customer who ordered it.
```
 
Write an SQL query to report all customers who never order anything.

Return the result table **in any order**.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Customers table:
+----+-------+
| id | name  |
+----+-------+
| 1  | Joe   |
| 2  | Henry |
| 3  | Sam   |
| 4  | Max   |
+----+-------+
Orders table:
+----+------------+
| id | customerId |
+----+------------+
| 1  | 3          |
| 2  | 1          |
+----+------------+
Output:
+-----------+
| Customers |
+-----------+
| Henry     |
| Max       |
+-----------+
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    name AS Customers
FROM
    customers
WHERE
    id NOT IN (
        SELECT
            customerId
        FROM
            orders
    )
ORDER BY
    name ASC;
```
