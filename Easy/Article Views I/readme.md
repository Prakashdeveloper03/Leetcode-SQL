**Views Table**
```
+---------------+---------+
| Column Name   | Type    |
+---------------+---------+
| article_id    | int     |
| author_id     | int     |
| viewer_id     | int     |
| view_date     | date    |
+---------------+---------+
There is no primary key for this table, it may have duplicate rows.
Each row of this table indicates that some viewer viewed an article (written by some author) on some date.
Note that equal author_id and viewer_id indicate the same person.
```

Write an SQL query to find all the authors that viewed at least one of their own articles.

Return the result table sorted by `id` in ascending order.

The query result format is in the following example.

__Example 1:__
```
Input:
Views table:
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| article_id | author_id | viewer_id | view_date  |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
| 1          | 3         | 5         | 2019-08-01 |
| 1          | 3         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 2          | 7         | 7         | 2019-08-01 |
| 2          | 7         | 6         | 2019-08-02 |
| 4          | 7         | 1         | 2019-07-22 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
| 3          | 4         | 4         | 2019-07-21 |
+------------+-----------+-----------+------------+
Output:
+------+
| id   |
+------+
| 4    |
| 7    |
+------+
```

### Solution
```sql
SELECT
    DISTINCT(author_id) AS id
FROM
    `Views`
WHERE
    author_id = viewer_id
ORDER BY
    author_id ASC;
```
